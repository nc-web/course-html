    <h4>TAG I</h4>
    <p>Mark up text that is set off from the normal prose in a document:</p>

    <p>
        Definition and Usage
        The <i> tag defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

        The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.

        Use the <i> element only when there is not a more appropriate semantic element, such as:

        em (emphasized text)
        strong (important text)
        mark (marked/highlighted text)
        cite (the title of a work)
        dfn (a definition term)
 
    </p>

    <p><i>Lorem ipsum</i> is the most popular filler text in history.</p>

    <p>The <i>RMS Titanic</i>, a luxury steamship, sank on April 15, 1912 after striking an iceberg.</p>
